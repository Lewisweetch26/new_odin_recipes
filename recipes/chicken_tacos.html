<h1>Easy Chicken Street Tacos</h1>
<img src="../images/Chicken_tacos.jpeg" alt="chicken tacos">
<h2>Description</h2>
     <p>I go to my local Mexican Market and buy "pollo para asar" which translates to "chicken to grill." This chicken is seasoned and ready to grill. These delicious tacos are easy to make and topped with cilantro and onions. I serve them with guacamole, salsa and fresh lime wedges on the side.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 (5-inch) corn tortillas</li>
                <li>3 cups chopped cooked chicken</li>
                <li>4 sprigs fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped white onion</li>
                <li>1 cup guacamole</li>
                <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a paper towel on a microwave-safe plate and top with tortillas; heat in the microwave for 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until heated through, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Layer chicken, cilantro, onion, and guacamole, in that order, onto each tortilla. Squeeze lime juice over each taco.</li>
    </ol>
